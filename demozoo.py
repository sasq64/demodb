"""demozoo — populate a SQLite database from a Demozoo PostgreSQL dump and
export all releases in the named-field db format read by src/files.rs, the same
one bitworld.txt and csdb.txt use:

    id:1<TAB>title:Zentro 4<TAB>author:Zenith<TAB>date:1992-12-27<TAB>party:The
    Party 1992<TAB>platform:Amiga<TAB>category:Demo<TAB>tags:<TAB>download:http://...

Demozoo covers every platform, so unlike the single-platform bitworld.txt and
csdb.txt there is no `# Platform:` header — each line names its own platform.
Only the platforms in PLATFORM_WHITELIST are exported; releases carrying a
blacklisted tag (see TAG_BLACKLIST) are dropped, as are downloads with a
blacklisted extension (see DOWNLOAD_BLACKLIST) or a url demarc cannot read back
(see url_usable) -- and with them any release left without a download.
Graphics and music for which Demozoo records no platform at all are still
exported, with an empty platform field (see PLATFORMLESS_SUPERTYPES).

A `download` is either a whole url or, for the file archives Demozoo records as
a link_class plus a parameter, that pair as `SceneOrgFile:/parties/2006/x.zip`.
Which mirror such a link resolves to is demarc's to decide, not ours -- see the
URL resolution section below.

A release that Demozoo links to a pouet.net prod also gets a
`pouet:<cncds>,<thumbs>,<rank>,<won>,<nominated>` field, the last two being
space-separated award category ids ("pouet:9,398,19,1 5 7,8 55").  Where those
numbers come from is a choice:

  * by default only the per-platform toplists (top 64 each) are read, so only
    the handful of releases that made a list carry the field.  The pages are
    fetched at startup and cached under .pouet_cache.  A toplist row only
    carries the votes and the CDCs, so rank and awards come out empty.
  * with --pouet-prods the toplists are not read at all; instead every
    exported release that has a pouet link is looked up in pouet.py, which
    answers out of pouet's offline data dump (pouetdatadump-prods-*.json) if
    one is there and otherwise fetches and caches the prod's JSON API page.
    That covers every linked release rather than 64 per platform.  With a dump
    it costs nothing; without one it is a request per release -- tens of
    thousands on a cold cache, paced by --pouet-delay and, for a trial run,
    capped by --pouet-limit.

The two are alternatives, not a fallback: one source or the other.
--refresh-pouet refetches whichever is in use and --no-pouet skips the step.

Usage:
    python demozoo.py --sql demozoo-export.sql --db demozoo.sqlite \
        --out demozoo.txt

By default the database is rebuilt from the SQL file. Pass --skip-load to reuse
an existing SQLite database and only regenerate the export (much faster).

# keeps the pair as written,
#
#     download:SceneOrgFile:/parties/2006/assembly06/demo/bombman.zip
#
# and demarc turns that into a url when it downloads it (LINK_BASES in demarc's
# src/fetch.rs), where each class points at a list of mirrors that can be tried
# in turn.  A mirror that dies -- or a faster one appearing -- is then a demarc
# change rather than a regenerate of every db built from this dump.  The same
# goes for the fixups demarc applies to links that no longer work as recorded
# (URL_REWRITES there), which used to live here.
#
# BaseUrl is the exception: its parameter already is a whole url, so it is
# exported as it stands.
#
# One productionlink table holds both lists a Demozoo prod page shows: the
# download links and the external links (Pouet/csdb/Youtube/Bandcamp pages).
# demarc fetches the exported url and tries to *run* it, so only the former
# belong in `download:` -- a prod whose only links are info pages exports an
# empty download rather than a web page demarc cannot load.  Hence only file
# classes are listed here; everything else resolves to None and is dropped.
#
# The order is the order in which classes are preferred when a release has
# several links: the dedicated file archives first (matches bitworld, which
# points at files); BaseUrl last, since it is the catch-all class and its
# is_download_link flag is the only thing telling a file apart from a home page.
#
# Every class here must be one demarc knows, so keep this list and LINK_BASES
# in step.
